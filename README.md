# Polyphonic-Omr
 PyTorch code for end-to-end Optical Music Recognition (OMR) on polyphonic scores. Derived from [the following repository](https://github.com/OMR-Research/tf-end-to-end) which is TensorFlow code for OMR on monophonic scores.

# Fork info
This fork of original repo [polyphonic-omr](https://github.com/sachindae/polyphonic-omr) has been made for a purpose of making my bachelor's thesis, which should be out around June 2023.
I'll add a link here and try to add proper citation to this repo and the thesis it was used to make.

# Citation
This code was used in the experiments from the paper:

"An Empirical Evaluation of End-to-End Polyphonic Optical Music Recognition"

# Instructions
1. First go through the README in data_download
2. Next go through the README in label_gen
3. Finally go through the README in experiment_code
